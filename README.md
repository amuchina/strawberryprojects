just my failed projects ;)

- Calculator:
This is my first project with Java, just a scientific calculator (not finished) allowed to do scientific calculations like log, sin, cos ecc.
If you type "help" or "commands" in the first blank the calc will show you the list of available commands.
Forgive me if there are some bugs or something incorrect, this is my first project and is also in developing.
Hoping you like it.
Contact me for any questions :)

v. 1.0:
- Basic calculations
- Scientific calculations
- Not concatenated operations
- Break the program after 1 operations
- Type "help" to show available functions
